# go-java-launcher

A simple Go program for launching programs from a fixed configuration. This program replaces Gradle-generated Bash
launch scripts which are susceptible to attacks via injection of environment variables of the form `JAVA_OPTS='$(rm -rf
/)'`.

The launcher accepts as configuration two YAML files as follows:

```yaml
# StaticLauncherConfig - java version
# REQUIRED - The type of configuration, must be the string "java"
configType: java
# REQUIRED - The version of the configuration format, must be the integer 1
configVersion: 1
# REQUIRED - The main class to be run
mainClass: my.package.Main
# OPTIONAL - Path to the JRE, defaults to the JAVA_HOME environment variable if unset
javaHome: javaHome
# REQUIRED - The classpath entries; the final classpath is the ':'-concatenated list in the given order
classpath:
  - ./foo.jar
# OPTIONAL - Environment Variables to be set in the environment (Note: cannot be referenced on args list)
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: CUSTOM_VALUE
# OPTIONAL - JVM options to be passed to the java command
jvmOpts:
  - '-Xmx1g'
# OPTIONAL - Arguments passed to the main method of the main class
args:
  - arg1
```

```yaml
# StaticLauncherConfig - executable version
# REQUIRED - The type of configuration, must be the string "executable"
configType: java
# REQUIRED - The version of the configuration format, must be the integer 1
configVersion: 1
# OPTIONAL - Environment Variables to be set in the environment (Note: cannot be referenced on args list)
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: CUSTOM_VALUE
# REQUIRED - The full path to the executable file, limited to whitelisted values (java, postgres, influxd, grafana-server)
executable: "{{CWD}}/service/bin/postgres"
# OPTIONAL - Arguments passed to the main method of the excutable or main class
args:
  - arg1
```

```yaml
# CustomLauncherConfig
# REQUIRED - The type of configuration, must be the string "java" or "executable"
configType: java
# REQUIRED - The version of the configuration format, must be the integer 1
configVersion: 1
# OPTIONAL - Environment Variables to be set in the environment, will override defaults in static config (Note: cannot be referenced on args list)
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: CUSTOM_VALUE
  CUSTOM_PATH: '{{CWD}}/some/path'
# Additional JVM options to be passed to the java command, will override defaults in static config. Ignored if configType is "executable"
jvmOpts:
  - '-Xmx2g'
```

The launcher is invoked as:
```
go-java-launcher [<path to StaticLauncherConfig> [<path to CustomLauncherConfig>]]
```

where the
static configuration file defaults to `./launcher-static.yml` and the custom configuration file defaults to
`./launcher-custom.yml`. It assembles the configuration options and executes the following command (where `<static.xyz>`
and `<custom.xyz>` refer to the options from the two configuration files, respectively):

```
<javaHome>/bin/java \
  <static.jvmOpts> \
  <custom.jvmOpts> \
  -classpath <classpath entries> \
  <static.mainClass> \
  <static.args>
```

Note that the custom `jvmOpts` appear after the static `jvmOpts` and thus typically take precendence; the exact
behaviour may depend on the Java distribution.

`env` block, both in static and custom configuration, supports restricted set of automatic expansions for values
assigned to environment variables. Variables are expanded if they are surrounded with `{{` and `}}` as shown above
for `CUSTOM_PATH`. The following fixed expansions are supported:

* `{{CWD}}`: The current working directory of the user which executed this process

Expansions are only performed on the values. No expansions are performed on the keys. Note that the JAVA_HOME
environment cannot be overwritten with this mechanism; use the `javaHome` mechanism in `StaticLauncherConfig` instead.
