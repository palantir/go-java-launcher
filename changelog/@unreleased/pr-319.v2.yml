feature:
  description: Add support for setting the `-XX:ActiveProcessorCount` argument driven
    by detecting cgroup `cpu.shares` and some heuristics around behavior when running
    with too few processors. This feature is enabled within a new `experimental` configuration
    block, with the intent of indicating the stability of the feature.
